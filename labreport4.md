```
Keys Pressed: <up> <Enter>

I logged into ieng6 on my account by pressing the up arrow key and then the Enter key because the command was already in my terminal history.

### Step 5 Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL):

I cloned the forked repository of lab7 inside the ieng6 by pasting the ssh URL (git@github.com:NoahTerrellUCSD/lab7.git)
